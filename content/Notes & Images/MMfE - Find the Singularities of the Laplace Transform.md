# General Solution
1. Find the **Laplace Transform**
2. Find the poles of $F(s)$ which can be **simple** (multiplicity = 1), or **pole of order $k$** (multiplicity = $k$)

Once we have found the Laplace Transformation $F(s) = \mathcal{L}[u(t)]$ we just need to find its poles, for that values of $s$ the function will go to $\infty$, so they are defined as **singularities**.
